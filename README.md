This was my first go at building a React app. I decided to try and recreate my personal website which was originally programmed in jQuery. The idea was to make it look, feel and function exactly as the jQuery one did.


<strong>Install Node Modules</strong>
$ npm install

<strong>Build React App</strong>
$ gulp build
